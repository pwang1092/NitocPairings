# NitocPairings
Calculated NITOC out rounds pairings based on upper bracket losers and lower bracket drops. 
Used two txt files with teams and seeds for each team in both brackets, copied before break announcements from postings. 
Typed in seeds for losing teams in uppers and lowers and program would generate next rounds postings and take a query for the team we want to find the pairing for
(Useful because NITOC would post like 15 minutes after live break announcements so this would give us some time to know who we would hit before teams had to head to rounds)
